This code was created to create a Monte Carlo simulation simulating single photon absorbtion in a superconducting metal. 
The Fanofunctions_final file contains all the functions needed to calculate all the outcomes of all possible interactions and chances of those outcomes.
The simulationfunction file contains the fucntions needed to run the simulation, as well as some code to save some data. 
The map labeled time contains a modified version of Fanofunctions_final and simulationfunction that do the same calculations, but do so as a function of time.
